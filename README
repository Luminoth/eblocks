----------
Requirements
----------

Linux
glibc 2.2
SDL 1.2.4

----------
Source Installation
----------

Installation is pretty easy. Just unpack the source:

$ tar -xzvf eblocks-1.0.0-src.tar.gz

and compile it:

$ cd eblocks/
$ make

Assuming everything goes without any error (if not, please send an error report to aszwad@softhome.net)
you can copy the bin/ and data/ directories to where you'll be running EBlocks from. Then you can run
it from one level up from the bin directory, ie:

$ bin/eblocks

----------
Binary Installation
----------

If you downloaded just the binary package, you have everything you need. Just unzip the tarball:

$ tar -xzvf eblocks-1.0.0.tar.gz

and run it from the top-level directory:

$ bin/eblocks

----------
Playing the Game
----------

Controls:
    Up - rotate the current tetramino clockwise
    Down - drop the current tetramino to the bottom
    Left - move the current tetramino left
    Right - move the current tetramino right

For more advanced players, the X and Z keys may be used to rotate the current tetramino
clockwise and counter-clockwise, respectively.

----------
What to do when something breaks
----------

If something doesn't work, or you want to tell me EBlocks sucks, please address an e-mail
to aszwad@softhome.net. If it's an error report, please include as MUCH detail as possible.
You should at least include what system you're running on, what version of SDL you have, and any
core dumps and additional information you can come up with.

If you have changes to the source you'd like me to incorporate, please attach an appropriate patch
with a short description of what the patch will do and why it should be done.
